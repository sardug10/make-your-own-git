This project is my implementation of Git internals written in Go, inspired by the [Codecrafters Git challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/git/overview). 
Itâ€™s a step-by-step rebuild of core Git commands like init, cat-file, hash-object, ls-tree, write-tree, and commit-tree.

I document the git `init`, `cat-file`, and `hash-object` in this [article](https://medium.com/@duggal.sarthak12/building-your-own-git-from-scratch-in-go-01166fcb18ad). 
and `ls-tree`, `write-tree`, and `commit-tree` are covered [here](https://github.com/sardug10/notes/blob/main/Creating%20or%20Reading%20a%20tree%20object.md).

If youâ€™re curious to try the same Git challenge, hereâ€™s a link that will give you 40% off on CodeCrafter's subscription : [**40% off link**](https://app.codecrafters.io/join?via=sardug10)

The goal is to deeply understand how Git works under the hood â€” from object storage and hashing to trees and commits â€” by recreating it from scratch.

ðŸš§ Still in progress â€” more stages coming soon (git clone next!).
